# Polytect: Deep Learning Defect Detection
Real-Time Classification of Polymer Insulator Defects using Deep Learning

Abstract:
Insulators are important to the integrity of the power grid. There are two main types: ceramic and non-ceramic (polymer) insulators. While the former are stable, their performance quickly degrades due to pollution, while the latter has a hydrophobic surface and can maintain higher performance for longer. Over time however, polymer insulators lose their hydrophobicity, which makes it very important to assess their surface conditions. The IEEE standards have developed a guide to classify the hydrophobicity from 1 to 7 and the classification received from this scale will depend on the expertise of the utility engineer. This is a slow process and expert utility engineers are not always available, which creates a need to automate the process of assessing the hydrophobicity. This projectâ€™s objective will be developing a phone app that uses deep learning to assist identifying the hydrophobicity class of the polymer surface, bridging the gap between hardware and software in the power grids industry. Through real-time image processing or photo uploads, the app will allow users to view what hydrophobicity classification level the polymer insulator currently has. Furthermore, numerous data sets exist to pre-train our deep learning model, allowing for generalized and non-bias results to be consistently shown.
